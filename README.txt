								Distance Finder 

=====================================================================================
This program is designed to calculate the distance between the camera and an object.
This requires the user to input a calibration image prior to inputting the image of
interest(.png or .jpg image or calibration text file). First the program needs to 
calculate the focal length of the camera usingthe calibration image. The user would 
need to input the known width and distance from the object for this calibration.

The user then input a second image(.png or .jpg image), the image with the object of 
interest, into the program in order to find the distance from the object. After
inputting the image, the user would need to layout the width of the object by click on 
the respected points on the image. After finding the distance, the user could select 
another image or change the calibration file.
